## What can you do now?

If you are following the [HTML & CSS: Module 1](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/webdev-module-1) pathway, you can move on to the [Mystery letter](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/mystery-letter) project. In this project, you will create a mystery letter that looks like each word has been cut from a different newspaper, magazine, comic or other source.

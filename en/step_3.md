## Ingredients

Let’s list the ingredients that are needed for your recipe.



+ Open this template trinket: [jumpto.cc/html-template](http://jumpto.cc/html-template){:target="_blank"}.

	The project should look like this:

+ For your list of ingredients, you’re going to use an __unordered list__, using the `<ul>` tag. Go to line 8 of the template and add this HTML, replacing the text in the `<h1>` title with the name of your own recipe:

```
<h1>Banana Milkshake</h1>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>

</ul>
```

+ View your webpage, and you should see your two headings.

You won’t see your list yet though, because you haven’t added any list items to it!

+ The next step is to add list items into your list, by using the `<li>` tag. Add the following code inside your `<ul>` tag:

```
<li>1 banana</li>
```

As your list is unordered, there are no numbers next to the list items, just bullet points.

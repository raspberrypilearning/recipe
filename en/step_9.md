## Challenge: More colours!
Change the colours in your code by using colour names, `rgb()` values and hex codes. Thereâ€™s a list of loads of colours at <a href="http://jumpto.cc/colours" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colours</a>, or you can go to <a href="http://jumpto.cc/colour-picker" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colour-picker</a> and create your own colours!

Here are some example colours:

+ Red can be written as:
	+ `red` (obviously!)
	+ `rgb(255,0,0)` (loads of red, no green and no blue)
	+ `#ff0000`

+ Olive can be written as:
	+ `olive`
	+ `rgb(128, 128, 0)` (a bit of red and green, and no blue)
	+ `#808000`

Try to make sure that the colours you use match your recipe!

## Challenge: More colours!
Change the colours in your code by using colour names, `rgb()` values and hex codes. There’s a list of loads of colours at <a href="http://jumpto.cc/colours" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colours</a>, or you can go to <a href="http://jumpto.cc/colour-picker" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colour-picker</a> and create your own colours!

Here are some example colours:

+ Red can be written as:
	+ `red` (obviously!)
	+ `rgb(255,0,0)` (loads of red, no green and no blue)
	+ `#ff0000`

+ Olive can be written as:
	+ `olive`
	+ `rgb(128, 128, 0)` (a bit of red and green, and no blue)
	+ `#808000`

Try to make sure that the colours you use match your recipe!


Ask a few of your friends to leave a review for your recipe. You’ll need to make another list to do this.

Can you add an image into your webpage? Or change the font? Here’s how your webpage could look:

Here’s some code that will help you:

```
font-family: Arial / Comic Sans MS / Courier / Impact / Tahoma;
font-size: 12pt;
font-weight: bold;

## Method

Next, let’s explain how to make your recipe.



+ You’re going to use another list to write your method, but this time you’ll be using an __ordered list__, by using the `<ol>` tag.

An ordered list is a numbered list, which you should use when the order of the steps is important.

Add this code underneath your ingredients list, making sure that it’s still inside your `<body>` tag:

```
<h3>Method:</h3>

<ol>

</ol>
```

+ Now you just need to add list items into your new ordered list:

```
<li>Peel the banana and add to a blender</li>
```

Notice that the list items are automatically numbered!

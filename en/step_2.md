## Decide on a recipe

Before you get coding, you’ll need to decide on a recipe.



+ Think about a recipe you want to share with your friends. It could be:
	+ A recipe you found online;
	+ Your favourite meal;
	+ Something you made up!

The example recipe you’ll see in this project is for a banana milkshake. You can copy this recipe if you can’t find one of your own.

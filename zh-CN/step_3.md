## Ingredients

Let’s list the ingredients that are needed for your recipe.

+ For your list of ingredients, you’re going to use an **unordered list**, using the `<ul>` tag. Go to line 8 of the template and add this HTML, replacing the text in the `<h1>` title with the name of your own recipe:

    <h1>Banana Milkshake</h1>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    
    <ul>
    
    </ul>
    

+ View your webpage, and you should see your two headings.

You won’t see your list yet though, because you haven’t added any list items to it!

+ The next step is to add list items into your list, by using the `<li>` tag. Add the following code inside your `<ul>` tag:

    <li>1 banana</li>

As your list is unordered, there are no numbers next to the list items, just bullet points.

## Decide qué receta quieres hacer

Antes de empezar a programar, necesitarás escoger una receta.

+ Think about a recipe you want to share with your friends. It could be: 
    + A recipe you found online;
    + Your favourite meal;
    + Something you made up!

The example recipe you’ll see in this project is for a banana milkshake. You can copy this recipe if you can’t find one of your own.
